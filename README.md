# Predicting-the-critical-temperature-of-Superconductors

Dataset:
This dataset contains 21263 observations and 82 columns.
The target variable is 'critical_temp'. 

Download the csv file. The csv file is the data which i have used to train and test my model. Run the program file in Python. Used PCA for dimension reduction. I have used 3 algorithms namely Linear Regression, Neural network and random forest. Implemented Grid Search to find the best parameters for the random forest and then fit the model using the best parameters. 

Among all 3 models, Random Forest Regressor produced the lowest RMSE with a value of 13.12
